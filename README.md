        <p style="background-color:green;font-size:40px" id="a"> <big>There</big> are many sports I <del>like</del> <ins>enjoy</ins> both playing and watching. To <em>name</em> a few, I used to play soccer and sometimes even <s>cricket</s>. I also currently play badminton. <i>Overall</i>, my favorite sport is definitely <mark>badminton</mark>. My <u>neighbor</u> and I play it often in <sub>spring</sub> and <sup>summer.</sup> If we were to be discussing favorite activity, <abbr title="a type of martial art where two people duel using wooden katanas">kendo</abbr> would be my favorite. <small>Badminton</small> is a relatively easy sport and it's usually my <b>go-to</b> whenever my family and I go somewhere outside. </p>

            <p style="color:red;background-color:purple" id="b"> <big>I</big> have had lots of <strong>food</strong> in my twelve <span style="font-size:30px;background-color:white;color:black">years of life [As I should]</span>. There have been a lot of different types, like croissants, ice cream, cakes, fruit, vegetables, etc etc, you get it, the list goes on. There have been some really exceptional types. My favorite foods are <mark>donuts, pizza, popsicles, popCORN and mandarin oranges</mark>. <abbr title="The mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata), also known as mandarin or mandarine, is a small citrus tree fruit. Treated as a distinct species of orange, it is usually eaten plain or in fruit salads. Tangerines are a group of orange-coloured citrus fruit consisting of hybrids of mandarin orange with some pomelo contribution.">Mandarin oranges</abbr> are like <sub>mini oranges</sub>. They taste good, they are <b>easy to peel,</b> and they're good for you! Popsicles are great on sunny days. I would be playing basketball with my friends, and then I would say,"We need a break. Who wants popsicles?" Everyone would want the <em>good flavors,</em> except for one of my friends, who apparently <i>loves grape</i>. Who likes <small>grape?</small> It's ok, I guess. On <sup>Fridays,</sup> my dad brings pizza! We get two types, I get chicken and my parents get jalapeno. Popcorn is a fan-favorite for the movies, but after I eat lunch [And if I become hungry], I microwave some popcorn to eat. <u>Donuts</u> are really sweet and I usually eat <del>small</del><ins>mini</ins> donuts if I need a quick snack. These are some of my favorite foods!</p>
